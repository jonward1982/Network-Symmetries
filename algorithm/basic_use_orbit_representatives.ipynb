    "# Counting graph colourings\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph or network $\\Gamma$ is a set of vertices $V$ connected together by a set of edges $E$ (i.e. pairs of vertices). Given a finite set of colours $W$, a colouring of a graph asigns a colour to each vertex, so is a function from the set of vertices to the set of colours. The set of all colourings is $\\Omega=W^V$, i.e. the set of all functions from the set of vertices to the set of colours.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph symmetry or automorphism $g$ is a permutation of the vertices that leaves the graph unchanged, i.e. for $u,v\\in V$ we have $(u,v)\\in E$ if and only if $(gu,gv)\\in E$. The automorphism group $G$ of a graph is the set of all of the graph's automorphisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "An automorphism can act on a graph colouring by moving the colours. More precisely we define the action of an automorophism $g\\in G$ on a colouring $S\\in\\Omega$ so that for $v\\in V$ we have $gS(gv)=S(v)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in counting colourings that are equivalent under the action of the automorphim group, i.e. for $S_1,S_2\\in\\Omega$, there is a $g\\in G$ such that $S_1=gS_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at some of the that I have developed to do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start by setting up a graph. There is a class in the `OPP` module for graphs, so we start by loading this module."
