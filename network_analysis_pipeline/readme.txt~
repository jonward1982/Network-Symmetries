The graphs directory contains a directory called format_scy in which I have put a directory called test_examples which has a few very simple, small graphs written in a file format that can be read by the saucy program. Within the format_scy folder I imagine having directories of graphs that are related in some way. Within the graphs directory, I imagine we could have graphs in different formats.

The gaut directory contains the python code that runs saucy for individual files (run_saucy.py) and batches (run_batch_saucy.py). (The saucy_mac file is a binary that runs the saucy code, which would need to be produced on a given machine.) There is a directory test_examples that contains the results of running run_batch_saucy.py.
